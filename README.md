<h1>🎲 COUNTRY GEEK GAME 🎮</h1>
<h3>🥇 This is my first 'bigger' project made in plain javascript and plain css. </br> ⚡ Here I used some API with countries databases, but the game is limited to europe countries. </br>🕹 There are 2 game modes, go check for them in the  link presented in "About" section </h3>
<h4>NOTE: I did not finish responsive work so you can use it only on desktop 😅</h4>
